### reminder (to Wagner; to be deleted)
- adapt 'customcert' insertion logic to manipulate and insert as many instances as i want to
- adapt 'customcert_templates' to fit the 'agroupment' needed to be able to get that customcert instance
- adapt 'load()' call to use a list of 'customcert_templates' ids (same as course_ids) instead of a string
- adapt 'reengagement' logic to one specific instance target specific 'course_module' (the first one of the 'content'/'conte√∫do' section)
